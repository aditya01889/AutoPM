   ```bash
   python run_demo.py
   ```

2. Take screenshots of:
   - The terminal showing the full demo output
   - The source code in your favorite editor
   - The project structure

3. Save screenshots in the `docs/images/` directory with descriptive names:
   - `demo-output.png`
   - `project-structure.png`
   - `code-screenshot.png`

## Adding to Your Portfolio

Include 2-3 key screenshots in your portfolio with captions explaining what each one shows. For example:

1. **Demo Output** - Shows the AutoPM demo in action, aggregating updates from multiple sources.
2. **Project Structure** - Demonstrates the clean, modular architecture of the codebase.
3. **Code Example** - Highlights a key piece of functionality, like the AI summarization logic.
